# Work with files and directories in a .NET app

Build an app that manipulates files and directories with C# and .NET.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Work with directories.
- Create and delete files.
- Read from files.
- Write to files.
- Parse data in files.
